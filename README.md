### Academic Project
**METRICS FOR EVALUATING CLASS ACTIVATION MAPPING(CAM) TECHNIQUES ‚Äì Research Project**
-	Proposed the new metrics based on the impact of irrelevant features and experimented with four different CAM methods on three pre-defined models using two different dataset.
-	Research was implemented using Open CV, Tensorflow and Keras.
-	Based on the results the proposed new metrics are suitable for evaluating CAM for better model understanding when compared to the current metrics.

**DATA INSIGHT FROM Covid Vaccine Dataset:  - Research Seminar** 
-	 Gathered data from twitter hashtag and cleaning the dataset using Pandas.
-	 Analysed the data and created various data insights using pandas and provided visual solutions using matplot to various research questions. 

**Prediction of Energy Data Consumption:  - Mini project**
-	Cleaned and pre-processed the time series data using pandas.
-	Built the LSTM -based model to prediction of energy consumption for set of tasks using Tensorflow and keras.

**Analysing the Depth of RNN: - Mini Project**
-	Generated the time series data based on the Lorenz equation using python.
-	 Analysing the behavior of the Encoder-Decoder RNN architectural depth by adjusting its hyperparameters using Tensorflow and Keras.
