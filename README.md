### Work Experience

**WORKING STUDENT & MASTER THESIS at FRAUNHOFER FEP, DRESDEN**   01/2022 - present
- Proposed a neural-network-based CNN architecture for segmenting & classifying the OLED Microdisplay Images based on their quality and defect types categories. 
- Proposed model achieves up to 97% accuracy and saves time by a factor of 6 times higher than the existing system.

**INTERN at FRAUNHOFER FEP, DRESDEN**   10/2021 - 12/2021

- Built a lightweight classification model to classify the micro-display images into the defect and non-defect categories using Keras and TensorFlow.
- Labeled the micro-display images and pre-processed the images using open CV.
- The model achieves 91% accuracy on one variant and 98% accuracy on other variant images.

**TECHNOLOGY CONSULTANT at Virtusa Consulting Services, INDIA**    11/2019 - 09/2020

- Developed many data processing pipelines to extract data from various RDBMS into the Hadoop environment using Sqoop, Hive, and pyspark and followed agile way of    developing pipelines.

**SOFTWARE DEVELOPER at Sysbiz Technologies, INDIA**    Jan/2019 ‚Äì Nov/2019

- Involved in developing the heterogeneous data analysis platform, which ingests data from various sources into the Hadoop environment and handled all data-related activities related to business objectives.
- Developed many pipelines related to machine learning using the collected data according to the business requirements and deploying the ETL pipelines and trained AI models into the distributed environment (cloud).

**SYSTEM ENGINEER at TATA Consulting Services, INDIA**   Oct/2015 ‚Äì Jan/2019

- Involved in developing many ETL pipelines to extract data from various relational databases to the Hadoop platform using Sqoop & Apache Hive.
- Optimized the developed pipelines using optimization techniques related to the environment, which saved around 25% of the time than the current system.


### Academic Project
**METRICS FOR EVALUATING CLASS ACTIVATION MAPPING(CAM) TECHNIQUES ‚Äì Research Project**
-	Proposed the new metrics based on the impact of irrelevant features and experimented with four different CAM methods on three pre-defined models using two different dataset.
-	Research was implemented using Open CV, Tensorflow and Keras.
-	Based on the results the proposed new metrics are suitable for evaluating CAM for better model understanding when compared to the current metrics.

**DATA INSIGHT FROM Covid Vaccine Dataset:  - Research Seminar** 
-	 Gathered data from twitter hashtag and cleaning the dataset using Pandas.
-	 Analysed the data and created various data insights using pandas and provided visual solutions using matplot to various research questions. 

**Prediction of Energy Data Consumption:  - Mini project**
-	Cleaned and pre-processed the time series data using pandas.
-	Built the LSTM -based model to prediction of energy consumption for set of tasks using Tensorflow and keras.

**Analysing the Depth of RNN: - Mini Project**
-	Generated the time series data based on the Lorenz equation using python.
-	 Analysing the behavior of the Encoder-Decoder RNN architectural depth by adjusting its hyperparameters using Tensorflow and Keras.
